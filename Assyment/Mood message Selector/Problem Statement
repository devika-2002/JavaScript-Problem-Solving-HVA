Problem Statement
You are creating a simple mood selector for a wellbeing webpage. The page shows five mood buttons: 
Happy, Sad, Angry, Tired, and Excited. When the user clicks a button, a message box below should 
update to match the selected mood, and the page should clearly show which mood is currently chosen.



Your Task
1. In HTML, create:

Five buttons labeled Happy, Sad, Angry, Tired, and Excited. Give them the ids happyBtn, sadBtn, angryBtn, tiredBtn, and excitedBtn.

A <p> element with the id moodMessage where the selected mood message will appear.



2. In JavaScript:

a. When a mood button is clicked:

Update the text inside moodMessage to one of these messages:

Happy → "Great! Keep smiling today!"

Sad → "It's okay to feel down. Take a deep breath."

Angry → "Try stepping away for a moment."

Tired → "Make sure to rest and recharge."

Excited → "Love the energy! Keep it going!"

Remove the highlight from all buttons.

Add the highlight only to the clicked button.
