Problem Statement
You are building a small writing helper for a notes webpage. The page has a text box where the user can type, 
and a line of text shown just below it. As the user types, the same text should appear in that line so they 
can see what it will look like. Next to this line, there are three buttons that change how the text looks: 
one for text color, one for background color, and one for making the text bigger.



Your Task
1. In HTML, create:

A <textarea> with the id textInput where the user can type.

A <p> element with the id displayText where the typed text will be shown.

Three buttons labeled Add Text Color, Add Background Color, and Make Text Bigger with the ids textColorBtn, bgColorBtn, and bigTextBtn.



2. In JavaScript:

As the user types in the textInput box:

Read the text they typed.

Update the text inside displayText so it always shows the same text.

Use the input event for this.

When the Add Text Color button is clicked:

If the text is in its normal (black) color, change it to blue.

If it is already blue, change it back to black.

Change the button text between Add Text Color and Remove Text Color.

When the Add Background Color button is clicked:

If the text has no background color, make it yellow.

If it is already yellow, remove the background.

Change the button text between Add Background Color and Remove Background Color.

When the Make Text Bigger button is clicked:

If the text is normal size (16px), increase it to 24px.

If it is already 24px, return it to 16px.

Change the button text between Make Text Bigger and Make Text Normal.
