Problem Statement
You are creating a simple shopping list. The user can type an item and add it to the list, and 
each item will appear with a Delete button so it can be removed. The page should also show how many items are currently in the list.



Your Task
1. In HTML, create:

An <input> box with the id itemInput where the user can type the item name.

A <button> with the id addBtn labeled Add Item.

A <p> with the id errorMsg for displaying error messages (initially it will be empty).

A <p> with the id itemCount starting with the text Total Items: 0.

A <div> with the id itemList where all items will be shown (initially it will be empty).



2. In JavaScript:

When the Add Item button is clicked:

Read the text from itemInput.

If the text is empty:

Show an error message in errorMsg - "Please enter an item".

Do not add anything to the list.

If the text is not empty:

Clear any error message from errorMsg.

Clear the text inside itemInput.

Create a new item block that contains:

The item name as text.

A Delete button for that item.

Add this new item block inside itemList.

Update the text in itemCount so it shows the new total number of items.

When a Delete button is clicked:

Remove that item from itemList.

Update the text in itemCount so it matches the current number of items.
