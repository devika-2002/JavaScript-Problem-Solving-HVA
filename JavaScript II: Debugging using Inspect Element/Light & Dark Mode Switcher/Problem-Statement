Problem Statement
You are designing a webpage that supports both Light Mode and Dark Mode. 
The page should start in Light Mode by default, and a button should allow users to switch between the two modes.

Note: Use Inspect Element in your browser to understand how your code is operating.

Your Task
Create an HTML page that contains:
A <div> element with the id page that wraps all content.
A <h1> element with the text:
Welcome to My Webpage

A <p> element with the text:
This page can switch between light and dark modes.

A <button> element with the label "Toggle Mode" and the id toggleBtn.
Set up CSS styles to define two modes:
.light-mode — white background with black text.
.dark-mode — black background with white text.
The page should start in Light Mode by default.
Write JavaScript code that performs the following:
When the Toggle Mode button is clicked:
Use the classList.toggle() method to switch the #page element between the .light-mode and .dark-mode classes.
If the page is in Light Mode, it should change to Dark Mode.
If the page is in Dark Mode, it should switch back to Light Mode.

Tip: Use Inspect Element in your browser to observe how the classes and styles change when toggling between modes.


Note: Write the HTML code in the HTML tab, CSS code in the CSS tab, and the JavaScript code in the JavaScript tab.
